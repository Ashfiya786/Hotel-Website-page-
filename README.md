We are going to have a bit of fun with our built restaurant web application. The front page of our web app contains 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map. If you click on the Specials tile, you will be taken to a single category page where all the menu items that belong to the Specials menu category will be shown. Our task is to alter this behavior such that when the user clicks on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category, be it “Lunch”, “Dinner”, “Sushi”, etc. That way, any random category can become the Specials! What fun! (not! :-) )


Once we are done, verify that the desired functionality is working correctly. Use Browser Sync or deploy your solution to GitHub pages.
Load the home page in the browser.
Click on the Specials tile. A single page category with a list of menu items for *some* category should appear.
Click on the restaurant logo to go back to the home page.
Click on the Specials tile again. Most likely, a different single page category page will be shown.
Repeat this several times to make sure that most of the time you see a different single category page.
That’s it!
